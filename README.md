Task 3 Find best results

For this problem you have the following situation: you are playing a game of tic-tac-toe, and you find the situation in the figure below, next is your turn, develop a quantum algorithm to be able to find the best decisions with higher probability.

    X | O | O
   -----------
    X |   | 
   -----------
    O |   |       
 


The following considerations apply:
You are the X's.
The matrix as a qubit and the state of the X's is |1> and of the O's is |0>, of the empty cells an unknown state.
What are the valid combinations to win?
You have at most 2 turns

 
I hope my solution is satisfactory :) <br>
Thank you for your time and the opportunity, <br>
